# SPA app "Service Desk"

### This react app created for my portfolio

---

This application is a system for submitting and processing tickets from users.
It contains functionality of sending, commenting and closing tickets. There is also a division of users into roles: "Support" and "User".

Webpack and other configs were created from scratch.

The project uses json-server as part of the Back-end.
To start the dev server, you need to write the commands:

- start json-server

```bash

	npm run backend

```

- start webpack-dev-server

```bash

	npm start

```
